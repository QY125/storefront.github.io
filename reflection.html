    <h1 >Reflection page</h1>
    <p><span class="big">According</span> to my final assessment and my research, the purpose and meaning of responsive design is going to make the element flexible and it means responsive design could work on different screens. For example, the requirement of my final assessment is building a store front page for mobile phones, it means that the size of the web page is not only to be compatible with the smaller screens such as mobile devices but also normal screens(pc, laptop. etc). Because we never know what devices that our customers are using to log in to this website, so the responsive design could make all the elements flexible with the different screens. All of the elements will not be the same size on different devices, the size is going to be defined by the customers. I also discovered the responsive design always uses short commands such as "device-width” when we are setting the size of a web page which is compatible with user’s devices. Percentage is another kind of responsive design because it only sets up a rate of size on the web page. Similarly, coordinates is also responsive design, it only requires the x and y which is the flexible position on different screens. </p>

    <p>Responsive design helps the layout of the elements more compatible with different web technologies, the picture will not be very small if the user’s monitor is very huge although the web site is working for mobile phones and it is also available to resize the window on pc, the layout will not be messy. </p>

    <p>I used device-width to set the web page more compatible with multiple types of device and max-width:100%;height:auto to make sure the most of the picture could fill the web page on mobile phones and the last is 100% of the font size.</p>

    <p>I have learned something about building web is the purpose of markup language and css are going to represent the object and improve the user experience on different devices. I need to set up more responsive design to improve the user experience of my website.</p>
